Empoxy is a port of the epoxy framework to emscripten.

Epoxy is a widely used library for OpenGL function pointer management. Epoxy
provides a "combined" header for various different opengl versions, and resolves
function name aliases between the different versions for you. It also requires
no initialization (function pointers are initialized as you use them), and has
minimal overhead / startup time.

Besides this, the implementation is much cleaner and simpler -- epoxy's dispatch
code is generated by a small (1000 lines) python script which reads the official
GL spec published by Khronos as a series of XML files. From this it outputs
appropriate C code, and this C code, mated with ~1000 lines of hand-written C,
is the total of the implementation. This means the library is not too hard to
understand and maintain, and as new versions of GL are released it is easy to
keep it up to date.

In order to provide emscripten support for Epoxy, we modified the python script
so that the batch code always requests function pointers from emscripten's
OpenGL compat layer, rather than from dynamically linked libs. This means that
we provide exactly the same header file for you to compile with.
