/**
 * @file dispatch_common.c
 *
 * Implements common code shared by the generated GL/EGL/GLX dispatch code.
 *
 * A collection of some important specs on getting GL function pointers.
 *
 * From the linux GL ABI (http://www.opengl.org/registry/ABI/):
 *
 *     "3.4. The libraries must export all OpenGL 1.2, GLU 1.3, GLX 1.3, and
 *           ARB_multitexture entry points statically.
 *
 *      3.5. Because non-ARB extensions vary so widely and are constantly
 *           increasing in number, it's infeasible to require that they all be
 *           supported, and extensions can always be added to hardware drivers
 *           after the base link libraries are released. These drivers are
 *           dynamically loaded by libGL, so extensions not in the base
 *           library must also be obtained dynamically.
 *
 *      3.6. To perform the dynamic query, libGL also must export an entry
 *           point called
 *
 *           void (*glXGetProcAddressARB(const GLubyte *))(); 
 *
 *      The full specification of this function is available separately. It
 *      takes the string name of a GL or GLX entry point and returns a pointer
 *      to a function implementing that entry point. It is functionally
 *      identical to the wglGetProcAddress query defined by the Windows OpenGL
 *      library, except that the function pointers returned are context
 *      independent, unlike the WGL query."
 *
 * From the EGL 1.4 spec:
 *
 *    "Client API function pointers returned by eglGetProcAddress are
 *     independent of the display and the currently bound client API context,
 *     and may be used by any client API context which supports the extension.
 *
 *     eglGetProcAddress may be queried for all of the following functions:
 *
 *     • All EGL and client API extension functions supported by the
 *       implementation (whether those extensions are supported by the current
 *       client API context or not). This includes any mandatory OpenGL ES
 *       extensions.
 *
 *     eglGetProcAddress may not be queried for core (non-extension) functions
 *     in EGL or client APIs 20 .
 *
 *     For functions that are queryable with eglGetProcAddress,
 *     implementations may choose to also export those functions statically
 *     from the object libraries im- plementing those functions. However,
 *     portable clients cannot rely on this behavior.
 *
 * From the GLX 1.4 spec:
 *
 *     "glXGetProcAddress may be queried for all of the following functions:
 *
 *      • All GL and GLX extension functions supported by the implementation
 *        (whether those extensions are supported by the current context or
 *        not).
 *
 *      • All core (non-extension) functions in GL and GLX from version 1.0 up
 *        to and including the versions of those specifications supported by
 *        the implementation, as determined by glGetString(GL VERSION) and
 *        glXQueryVersion queries."
